You should be aware of the following limitations when deciding to use Deno
Deploy EA:

- Pro account features do not extend to Deno Deploy EA yet.
- CLI deployment, and deployment from GitHub Actions are not available at this
  time.
- KV, Queues, and Cron are not available in Deno Deploy EA at this time.

:::info

Deno Deploy EA is an early access product, and as such is not covered by our
regular service level agreements yet.

:::

At this time, the Deno company is already using Deno Deploy EA to host our own
websites. As may imagine, we are putting significant care into avoiding any
service interruptions, but as this is a new system, service interruptions can
not always be avoided.**

While Deno Deploy EA is in closed beta, we are not charging for usage of the
platform. However, the
[Acceptable Use Policy](/deploy/manual/acceptable-use-policy/) and
[Terms and Conditions](/deploy/manual/terms-and-conditions/) still apply and we
reserve the right to terminate any user, organization, or app who we find to be
in violation of these.
